    <h2 class="card-header">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Ella Rises aims to empower the rising generation of women to pursue higher education and embrace their heritage through mentoring, creative workshops, and leadership opportunities that build both technical competence and artistic confidence.</p>
    <p>Leaders work together with partnerships at UVU and BYU to provide STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) programs to encourage women to pursue their interests in these fields.</p>

    <h2 class="card-header">What We Do</h2>
    <p>Ella Rises uses post-event surveys to measure the effectiveness of our programs. Primary measures include satisfaction, usefulness, and a recommendation score. We also keep track of milestones achieved - an indicator of long-term success.</p>
    <p>We want to quantify the impact of our events on key indicators of success. Tracking these things helps us identify high-impact activities and enables detailed reporting of program effectiveness to donors, sponsors, and project leadership.</p>
